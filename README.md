# Linear_Approximation_OPF

Repository's purpose:
This repository contains a linear model for the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, developed as part of my diploma's thesis. It includes implementation code, case files in XLSX format, and code for plotting results. Also, implementation code for DCOPF and Decoupled OPF is included.

### Files Explanation
- Linear_OPF generates the results of the proposed model
- Decoupled OPF generates the results of the Decoupled model
- DCOPF_BTheta generates the results of the BTheta model
- Plots generates the plots for all the models (it includes ACOPF model which is not in the repository)
